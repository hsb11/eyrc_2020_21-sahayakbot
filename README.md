## Theme - Sahayak Bot (Assistance Robot)
Original repo [link](https://github.com/vishalgpt579/sahayak_bot)

The theme that we got was Sahayak Bot. We had to program an Autonomous Ground Vehicle (AGV) to make it capable of autonomously traversing an indoor environment to assist moving objects from one place to another. The scenario was that objects were being moved in e-Yantraâ€™s lab and they were short of manpower so Sahayak bot was used to help move the boxes from one place to another.

Challenges in this theme inlcuded: 2D mapping, 3D mapping, Autonomous Navigation, Perception, Pick and Place.
